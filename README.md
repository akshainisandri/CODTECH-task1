## Project Overview: Student Grade Tracker

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Java program that can manage and track student grades for different subjects or assignments. The program allows users to input grades, calculate the average, determine the letter grade, and compute the GPA based on a standard 4.0 scale. The final output provides an overview of the student's academic performance.

### Features:

### Input Grades:
Users are prompted to input grades for a specified number of subjects or assignments.
Grades are stored in an array for easy management and processing.

### Calculate Average:
The program computes the average of the grades entered by the user.
This average serves as the basis for determining the overall performance of the student.

### Letter Grade Assignment:
Based on the average grade, the program assigns a corresponding letter grade.
The grading scale is as follows:
A: 90 and above
B: 80 to 89
C: 70 to 79
D: 60 to 69
F: Below 60

### GPA Calculation:
The program computes the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the average grade using the standard 4.0 scale:
A (90 and above) corresponds to a GPA of 4.0.
B (80 to 89) corresponds to a GPA of 3.0.
C (70 to 79) corresponds to a GPA of 2.0.
D (60 to 69) corresponds to a GPA of 1.0.
F (below 60) corresponds to a GPA of 0.0.

### Display Results:
After processing the grades, the program displays:
The calculated average grade.
The corresponding letter grade.
The GPA on a 4.0 scale.

### Workflow:

### User Input:
The user is prompted to input the number of subjects/assignments.
Grades are entered for each subject.

### Processing:
The program calculates the average grade.
It assigns a letter grade based on the calculated average.
It computes the GPA according to the average.

### Output:
The final result includes a summary displaying the average, letter grade, and GPA.
